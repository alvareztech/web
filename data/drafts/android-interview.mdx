## TDD

There are 3 rules:

1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code
2. You must not write more of a test that is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. Your must not write more production code that is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

In other words

1. Create a unit tests that fails.
2. Write just enough production code to makes that tests pass.
3. Clean up the mess you just made.

In other works

1. Make it fail
2. Make it work
3. Make it right
