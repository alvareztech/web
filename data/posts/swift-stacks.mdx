title: Stacks
summary: Swift doesn't have a dedicated Stack struct. Let's create our own Stack struct.

A stack uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering and these are its basic operations:

- `push(element)`: Add an element.
- `pop()`: Remove and return an element.
- `peek()`: Return the top element of the stack.
- `isEmpty()`

## First contact

Basically with an array we can do any type of operations, to create a Stack we only have to limit the behavior.

With the code below, you can see that with array methods, we can replicate a Stack functionality. `append()` to `push()`, `popLast()` to `pop()`.

```swift
var stack: [String] = []

stack.append("A")
stack.append("B")
stack.append("C")

while !stack.isEmpty {
    let e = stack.popLast()
    print(e ?? "")
}
```

### Output

```swift
C
B
A
```

Of course, this alternative is dangerous even for you, if you want a structure that always acts as a Stack you _must limit_ and not leave it open to use other array methods.

## Version 1: A struct

```swift
struct Stack {
    private var array: [String] = []

    mutating func push(_ element: String) {j
        array.append(element)
    }

    mutating func pop() -> String? {
        return array.popLast()
    }

    func peek() -> String? {
        return array.last
    }

    var isEmpty: Bool {
        array.isEmpty
    }

    var count: Int {
        array.count
    }
}
```

> Since the `push()` and `pop()` functions must modify the content or the array (which is an attribute of the `Struct`), then it is necessary that this function be `mutating`. Note that the `peek()` function does not modify or extract a value, it only reads the top element, that's why you don't need the `mutating` keyword.

### How to use

```swift
var stack = Stack()
stack.push("A")
stack.push("B")
stack.push("C")

while !stack.isEmpty {
    print(stack.pop() ?? "")
}
```

## Version 2: A generic stack

We don't want a Stack just for Strings, but rather for any type, for that we use **Generics**.

```swift
struct Stack<Element> {
    private var array: [Element] = []

    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        array.append(element)
    }

    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return array.popLast()
    }

    func peek() -> Element? {
        return array.last
    }

    var isEmpty: Bool {
        array.isEmpty
    }

    var count: Int {
        array.count
    }
}
```

### How to use

```swift
var stack = Stack<String>()

stack.push("A")
stack.push("B")
stack.push("C")

while !stack.isEmpty {
    print(stack.pop() ?? "")
}

```
