Tutorial to create a Pokédex app from scratch. The app uses Retrofit library to consume an API on Android. In addition to using Glide to download images.

__What you'll learn__

* Consume an API or Web Service with Retrofit
* Use a `RecyclerView` component in grid mode
* Handle `RecyclerView` events

__What you'll need__

* [Know how to obtain images with _Glide_](/videos/android/descargar-imagenes-glide/)

## Introduction

__API (0:22)__

* [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)

__Google Chrome Extension (1:10)__

* [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa)

### Images (1:47)

URL to obtain the images of the pokemon by their number.

```html
~~https://pokeapi.co/media/sprites/pokemon/25.png~~
```

__Update:__ The previous URL stopped working but you can get the image directly from the repository like this:

```html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/25.png
```

Pikachu is the pokemon number 25.

## Retrofit

```groovy
~~compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.1.0'~~
```

__Update:__ `compile` is _deprecated_ and there are new versions.

```groovy
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.7.1'
```
