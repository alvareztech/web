title: Queues
summary: Swift doesn't have a dedicated Queue struct. Let's create our own Queue struct.

As we did for the [Stacks](/swift-stacks), we are going to create our Queue `Struct`.

A queue uses FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering and these are its basic operations:

- `add(element)`: Or `enqueue(element)`, add an element.
- `remove()`: Or `dequeue()`, remove and return an element.
- `peek()`: Return the first element of the queue.
- `isEmpty()`

## First contact

Basically with an array we can do any type of operations, to create a Queue we only have to limit the behavior.

With the code below, you can see that with array methods, we can replicate a Queue functionality. `append()` to `add()`, `removeFirst()` to `remove()`.

```swift
var queue: [String] = []

queue.append("A")
queue.append("B")
queue.append("C")
```

```swift
while !queue.isEmpty {
    let e = queue.removeFirst()
    print(e)
}
```

### Output

```swift
A
B
C
```

## Version 1: A generic struct

```swift
struct Queue<Element> {
    private var array: [Element] = []

    mutating func add(_ element: Element) {
        array.append(element)
    }

    mutating func remove() -> Element? {
        array.removeFirst()
    }

    func peek() -> Element? {
        array.first
    }

    var isEmpty: Bool {
        array.isEmpty
    }
}
```

> Since the `add()` and `remove()` functions must modify the content or the array (which is an attribute of the `Struct`), then it is necessary that this function be `mutating`. Note that the `peek()` function does not modify or extract a value, it only reads the top element, that's why you don't need the `mutating` keyword.

> Remember that if the function has only one line of code you can save the `return` keyword.

### How to use

```swift
var queue = Queue<String>()

queue.add("A")
queue.add("B")
queue.add("C")

while !queue.isEmpty {
    let e = queue.remove()
    print(e ?? "")
}
```

Alternatively instead of using an array you can also use a `LinkedList` as the main container to create the `Struct`.
