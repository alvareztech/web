A python script to generate PDF (and HTML) Pull Request reports.

The report includes:

- Approvers for each PR with the approval date
- Modified files
- Merged time
- Commit hash
- Direct links to Github commits, users, and pull requests

## Running

It is possible to generate one or more repository reports with a command line with the following parameters:

```bash
python3 main.py --since v2.0 --until v2.8 --repos repo1,repo2
```

- `since`: Tag name of the penultimate version from which the report will be generated.
- `until`: Tag name of the latest version or the one from which the report is to be generated.
- `repos`: List of repositories (slug only) separated by a single comma (no spaces)
- `token`: Token or PAT (Personal Access Token) from Github. This parameter is optional if the `config.py` file is used.

The `repos` parameter can be set the following values to automatically generate reports from all repos in `util.py`.
