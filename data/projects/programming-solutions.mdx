More than 50 solutions (and growing every day) to problems of the popular platforms:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)

Mostly solutions in "modern languages" like _Swift_ and _Kotlin_.

I recommend using these solutions as a reference after solving them on the platforms. It's good to see alternative solutions or in other languages that you use.

Creating a habit to solve a daily problem is very good to improve the programming logic day by day. Just like going to the gym is good for the body. For example LeetCode has a daily challenge and they have rewards.
